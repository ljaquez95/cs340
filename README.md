How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?


Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable involves following good coding practices such as modular design, consistent naming conventions, and thorough documentation. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, this approach proved especially effective—it allowed us to encapsulate all database interactions in one place, making it easier to update or debug without affecting the rest of the codebase. When we integrated this module with the dashboard widgets in Project Two, the benefits were clear: the separation of concerns made the dashboard more flexible and reduced the chance of introducing errors. This structure not only saved time during development but also makes it easier to scale or adapt the system in the future. For instance, we could reuse the same CRUD module to support a mobile app interface or additional analytics tools without rewriting core database logic.

When approaching problems as a computer scientist, I tend to break them down into smaller, manageable tasks and analyze the problem requirements carefully before diving into implementation. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by understanding the database structure needed to support their use case, then mapped out how the dashboard should pull and display data. This process was more structured and client-focused than in previous coursework, where the emphasis was often on learning syntax or algorithms in isolation. In the future, I would continue to use this real-world, user-centered approach—incorporating strategies like iterative development, user feedback, and thorough testing—to design systems that meet client needs efficiently. Ultimately, computer scientists help solve complex problems through technology, and our work matters because it enables organizations like Grazioso Salvare to operate more effectively, make better decisions, and serve their missions more successfully.
